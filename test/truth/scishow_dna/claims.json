    "The DNA inside our cells is almost exclusively right-handed.",
    "Now, just to be clear, our DNA can temporarily form left-handed helices under incredibly specific conditions.",
    "And that's the kind of helix our cells are adapted to decode if our genetic information were left-handed, our cells wouldn't be able to use it!",
    "No matter how much you flip or twist a pair of chiral molecules, you can't superimpose them.",
    "why do all living cells only use left-handed nucleotides",
    "But a funny quirk about electrons from degraded atoms is that they are more likely to spin towards the left than the right. In fact, while rightward spinning electrons can be generated in a lab, they have never been observed in nature.",
    "They proposed that these lefty electrons could preferentially destroy chiral molecules of a single handedness, like the right-handed nucleotides that form left-handed DNA helices.",
    "Then, in 2015, scientists demonstrated that that's physically possible -- maybe. They shot a beam of left- or right-handed electrons at a gas and found a slight difference. The right-handed electrons destroyed 0.03% more right-handed gas molecules than lefty ones.",
    "But researchers believe it's possible that over billions of years, that miniscule percentage could add up or that this reaction could be amplified somehow through other means."
